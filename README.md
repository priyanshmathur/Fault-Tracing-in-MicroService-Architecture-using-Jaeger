# Microservice Architecture with Distributed Tracing
This is a microservice architecture consisting of two services: Admin and User. The services are built using Flask and PostgreSQL and are integrated with a distributed tracing system to enable effective monitoring and troubleshooting.

# Admin Service
The Admin service provides an API for adding products to a PostgreSQL database.The Admin service incorporates distributed tracing using Jaeger, allowing you to trace the execution flow and performance of requests.

# User Service
The User service provides an API for viewing and liking products stored in a PostgreSQL database.
